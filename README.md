## Breast Cancer Classification Metrics

This code evaluates a classification model on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The dataset is loaded using the `load_breast_cancer` function from scikit-learn. The following metrics are computed:
- Accuracy score
- Recall score
- F1 score
- Precision score
- Classification report

The evaluation is performed using the `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn to split the data into training and testing sets.

### Libraries Used
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib

### Functions Imported
- accuracy_score
- recall_score
- f1_score
- precision_score
- classification_report

### Dataset Used
- Breast Cancer Wisconsin (loaded using `load_breast_cancer` from scikit-learn)
